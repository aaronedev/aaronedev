- **High contrast**: Excellent readability with bright foreground (#f0f0f5) against the dark base
- **Color harmony features**: Built-in color manipulation utilities with commands like :VioletHarmony for generating complementary, triadic, and analogous color schemes

**Color Philosophy:**
The theme follows a "void" aesthetic - imagine coding in space with bright neon UI elements floating against the cosmic darkness. It uses:

- Electric blue (#29adff) for primary accents
- Neon green (#42ff97) for strings and positive states
- Hot pink/magenta (#fd7cff) for keywords and emphasis
- Bright purple (#bb7cff) for functions and special elements

**Dual Style Support:**

- violet-void (dark): The main neon-on-black aesthetic
- void-light: A companion light theme for daytime use

**Advanced Features:**

- Color harmony tools: Generate complementary color palettes from any hex color under cursor
- Terminal integration: Consistent colors across Neovim and terminal
- Plugin ecosystem: Extensive support for popular plugins with custom highlight groups
- Performance optimized: Cached color calculations and lazy loading

Perfect for developers who want a modern, cyberpunk-inspired coding environment that's both visually striking and functionally excellent.
