<div class="github-introduction">

I originally started out in web development, building fast and accessible applications with a focus on frontend usability. Over time, my interest expanded toward infrastructure and systems engineering, leading me to begin formal training as an IT Specialist for System Integration (Fachinformatiker f√ºr Systemintegration). Right now, I'm diving deep into network engineering, Linux system internals, and containerization technologies.

Along the way, I discovered a strong preference for Podman over Docker ‚Äì and I now consider myself a true Podman enthusiast, using it to build secure, rootless container environments tailored for real-world deployments.

## üåü Featured Projects
üåå The Violet Void Journey
- What started as a visual overhaul for Windows evolved into something much bigger. Originally, Violet Void was my attempt to bring a consistent, Linux-inspired environment to Windows ‚Äì merging aesthetic polish with advanced PowerShell-driven workflows.
- But during development, I increasingly hit technical walls that made further progress feel limiting. PowerShell was powerful, but the underlying OS kept getting in the way. That frustration turned into a decision: I made the switch to Arch Linux ‚Äì and since then, I haven‚Äôt looked back.
- While the original plan to release Violet Void for Windows has been retired, the core vision lives on. Many of the tools and ideas I built ‚Äì like key remapping daemons, modular configuration layers, and UI theming ‚Äì have made the transition to Linux. I‚Äôm now actively developing Violet Void for Hyprland, continuing to push for a deeply customizable and beautifully unified desktop experience.

## üìù Documentation with Neovim & Markdown
I believe documentation should be as elegant as the code it describes. While I previously worked with Obsidian, I now write all my notes and docs in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) using the [obsidian.nvim](https://github.com/obsidian-nvim/obsidian.nvim) plugin ‚Äì still powered by clean, portable Markdown. It gives me a minimal yet powerful setup that's fully integrated into my workflow.

### <p align="center">‚öôÔ∏è My development environment </p>

> I grew up with Windows and it holds a special place in my heart. It‚Äôs my go-to operating system for development, where I make extensive use of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and the Windows Terminal. I also use PowerShell, which I‚Äôve customized with my own configurations built from and modules scratch, to create a highly efficient and personalized terminal environment.
