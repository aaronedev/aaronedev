# Setup Guide: Fork This Profile

This guide will show you how to fork this GitHub Profile Repository and set it up on your end.

## Summary

This profile utilizes:

- readme-scribe to render README.md based on a template
- WakaTime for coding metrics integration
- GitHub Actions to automate every 3 hours (1:00, 4:00, 7:00 UTC)
- Custom Vercel deployments for GitHub stats badge generation

## Requirements

You will need:

- A GitHub account
- A WakaTime account (free at wakatime.com)
- Optional: Your own Vercel deployment of the GitHub stats (public ones will be fine as well)

## Setup in Steps

### 1. Fork this repository

Click the **Fork** button on GitHub to create `<your-username>/<your-username>`.

After the fork finishes, clone **your fork** locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-username>.git
cd <your-username>
```

This fork becomes your personalized profile repo—customize it to match your brand.

### 2. Setup GitHub Secrets

There are 2 secrets required for this workflow. You can add them in your repository settings:

Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret

The secrets needed are:

**GH_TOKEN**

A Personal Access Token with the following permissions:

- repo (Full control of private repositories)
- read:user (Read users' profile data)

Generated by going to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

Used by readme-scribe and waka-readme-stats

**WAKATIME_API_KEY**

WakaTime API key

Acquired from: https://wakatime.com/settings/account

Note that you may need to scroll down for the "API Key" section (you don't need your username here though, just your API Key)

Used by waka-readme-stats action

### 3. Update the template

You can render the template based on your preferences in templates/README.md.tpl.

First, update the basic information:

- Line 1: header text you want to have above - `text=Oi,%20World!%20I'm%20[YOUR-NAME]`
- Line 6: your GitHub username (the one people will use to view your profile) - `username=ahrwn → username=[your-username]`
- Line 7-12: your WakaTime user id - `@018cc02c-e893-42e6-b1c7-48cb3ef3ccfe → @[your-wakatime-id]`
- Line 13: your own repo from above - `aaronedev/aaronedev → [your-username]/[your-username]`
- Line 16: typing animation text - `lines=Linux+desktop+engineering;... → lines=[Your+Skills];[Your+Interests]`
- Line 19-21: your contact information with me - Matrix, email, etc.
- Lines 26-29: badges for GitHub Stats

Options for GitHub Stats Badges:

**Option A: Use public services (simplest option)**

```html
<img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=[your-username]&..." />
<img src="https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com/?user=[your-username]&..." />
```

**Option B: Deploy your own (what I did)**

Fork the repos and deploy to Vercel:

- Fork https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats
- Deploy to Vercel
- Update the URLs in the template to your deployment

```html
<img src="https://github-readme-stats-git-main-[your-project].vercel.app/api?username=[your-username]&..." />
<img src="https://github-readme-streak-stats-git-main-[your-project].vercel.app/?user=[your-username]&..." />
```

Then customize the rest of the template:

- Lines 31-38: What you do now
- Lines 40-45: Technology badges (add your own stack)
- Lines 47-52: What you can help with
- Lines 54-67: Featured projects (replace with your repos)
- Lines 69-70: Docs workflow or whatever you use

### 4. Test locally (optional but recommended)

You can test the template rendering before pushing.

Install readme-scribe:

```bash
go install github.com/muesli/readme-scribe@latest
```

Then render the template:

```bash
readme-scribe -template templates/README.md.tpl -output README.md
```

Or use the watch script I made:

```bash
./bin/watch-readme
```

This will auto-render whenever you save the template.

### 5. Enable GitHub Actions

Go to your repo settings:

Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions

Select:

- Read and write permissions
- Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests

Save.

### 6. Run the workflow

You have 2 options:

**Manual trigger (recommended for first run)**

- Go to Actions tab
- Click "Update README" workflow
- Click "Run workflow" button
- Click "Run workflow" again

**Wait for scheduled run**

The workflow runs every 3 hours automatically (1:00, 4:00, 7:00, 10:00, 13:00, 16:00, 19:00, 22:00 UTC)

### 7. Check if it worked

After the workflow runs, check:

- Actions tab shows green checkmark
- README.md got updated with your info
- WakaTime section has the placeholder (stats take 24-48 hours to populate)
- GitHub stats badges show up
- Recent activity sections show your PRs and contributions

## Customization

### Change update frequency

Edit `.github/workflows/readme.yaml` line 7:

```yaml
cron: "0 */3 * * *"  # every 3 hours (current)
cron: "0 */6 * * *"  # every 6 hours
cron: "0 0 * * *"    # daily at midnight
```

### WakaTime display options

Edit `.github/workflows/readme.yaml` lines 54-59.

Available options (set to "True" or "False"):

- SHOW_PROFILE_VIEWS
- SHOW_TOTAL_CODE_TIME
- And many more at https://github.com/anmol098/waka-readme-stats

### Add more template sections

The template uses Go templating.

Available functions:

- `{{ recentPullRequests 5 }}` - your recent PRs
- `{{ recentContributions 5 }}` - your recent contributions
- `{{ humanize .CreatedAt }}` - format dates nicely

See https://github.com/muesli/readme-scribe for all available functions.

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow fails with "Resource not accessible"

Your GH_TOKEN probably doesn't have the right permissions.

Fix:

- Generate a new token at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
- Make sure `repo` and `read:user` are checked
- Update the secret in your repo settings

### WakaTime section stays empty

This is normal at first.

It takes 24-48 hours for WakaTime to collect enough data.

Also check:

- WAKATIME_API_KEY is correct
- You have WakaTime installed and tracking your editor
- WakaTime is actually recording time (check wakatime.com/dashboard)

### GitHub stats badges not showing

Check:

- Username is correct in the template
- If using custom Vercel deployment, make sure it's deployed and accessible
- Try the public URLs first to test

### README not updating

Check:

- Workflow permissions are set to "Read and write"
- Both secrets are set correctly
- Look at the Actions tab for error messages in the workflow logs

### Workflow runs but doesn't commit

The workflow only commits if there are actual changes.

If your README is already up to date, it won't make an empty commit.
