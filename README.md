<div class="github-introduction">

I'm a **Web Developer** with a passion for bringing ideas to life in the browser. Growing up in the '90s and early 2000s, I fell in love with the internet, and that passion has driven me to design and develop websites and web applications that are **fast**, **responsive**, and **accessible** to everyone. I specialize in creating websites for clients with functionalities such as booking systems for apartments, hotels, restaurants, and more.

Additionally, I'm currently diving into the world of DevOps, expanding my skill set to streamline development processes and improve deployment efficiency.

## üåü Featured Projects

- **[Violet Void Theme](https://github.com/aaronedev/violet-void-theme)** üü£: **Violet Void Theme** is a set of configuration files designed to give Windows an amazing visual overhaul with a sleek, violet-toned aesthetic. This theme applies consistent violet tones throughout the interface, providing a unique and cohesive look that enhances the user experience. In addition to the visual enhancements, I‚Äôve also integrated several Linux-like functionalities into Windows, making the operating system more powerful and customizable for advanced users. Furthermore, I am working on custom glyphs to enhance the [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) experience, making it more visually appealing and user-friendly.

- I am working on a comprehensive **PowerShell profile** that integrates all my custom configurations into a powerful and cohesive setup. This profile is designed to streamline workflows and enhance productivity by leveraging the full potential of PowerShell, combined with my Violet Void Theme. Additionally, I am developing this profile to be fully featured and driven by Linux-like commands, bringing the familiarity and efficiency of Linux command-line tools to the Windows environment. Once finalized, I plan to publish this profile so that others can benefit from a fully optimized and visually appealing PowerShell environment.

## üìÉ I love documentation

Not many developers like to write documentation, but I do. I believe that a well-documented codebase is as important as the code itself. It‚Äôs like a story, telling what the code can do and how it works. I always try to write clear, concise, and useful documentation. My go-to documentation tool is <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian.md</a>.

In addition to my love for documentation, *I'm currently working on a custom Obsidian theme* as part of my **Violet Void theme** series. This theme features rich, deep purple colors with transparency effects, providing a sleek and modern look. I'm already using it myself, and it looks dope! I plan to release this theme soon so others can enjoy it as well.

Whenever I write documentation, I try to keep the following steps in mind to ensure the reader gets the most out of it:

1. **What** is this documentation about?
2. **Why** is this documentation important?
3. **How** can the reader use this documentation?
4. **When** should the reader use this documentation?
5. **Who** is this documentation for?

### <p align="center">‚öôÔ∏è My development environment </p>

> I grew up with Windows and it holds a special place in my heart. It‚Äôs my go-to operating system for development, where I make extensive use of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and the Windows Terminal. I also use PowerShell, which I‚Äôve customized with my own configurations built from and modules scratch, to create a highly efficient and personalized terminal environment.
